# Tic Tac Four

The world-first native and multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game with 4 in a row with many grid sizes.

We also plan to have tournaments.

## Motivation

The "3 in a row" rule dominate all Tic-Tac-Toe games, which limit the strategy thinking of the game.

There's a not well known "4 in a row" rule that increase the strategy planning to a level comparable to Checkers and Chess games.

## How To Play

Left-click the grid squares until you have a row with 4 items.

## Goals

- [ ] Implement a 8x8 grid
- [ ] Implement a color for each player
- [ ] Implement multiple grid sizes
- [ ] Implement the game mode with timer
- [ ] Implement WebRTC for P2P web browser multiplayer
- [ ] Implement a dedicated server
